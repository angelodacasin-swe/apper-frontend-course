## Homework
For this homework, create a folder called `**session-2**` in your `**apper-frontend-course`** repo and add two text 
files named `**checklist.txt**` and `**fetch-joke.txt**`. These two text files will contain the respective links 
of your CodeSandbox projects. With that being said, create your React projects from CodeSandbox.

1. Create an application that takes in text input from a user, and renders the inputs as part of an 
unordered list (a checklist). When the user clicks on a checklist item (specifically, the `<li>` element), 
that should be removed from the UI. The CodeSandbox project should be named `**Apper React Checklist`** and 
the link should be inside `**checklist.txt`.
  a. `checklist.map((item, **index**) => {})`
  b. Spread Operator
  c. Only one way to mutate state
